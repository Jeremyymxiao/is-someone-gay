### Build Issues & Solutions
1. Next.js Build Errors
   - Issue: `npm run build` failed with several errors:
     - TypeScript configuration conflicts
     - Page prerendering errors
     - Missing `_document` module
   
   - Solutions:
     - Restored Next.js recommended TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json`
     - Created necessary Next.js pages:
       - `src/pages/_document.tsx` for custom document structure
       - `src/pages/_app.tsx` for application wrapper
       - `src/app/not-found.tsx` for 404 page
       - `src/app/error.tsx` for error handling
     - Result: Successfully built the application with proper static and dynamic routes

2. TypeScript Configuration
   - Issue: Conflicts between script requirements and Next.js needs
   - Solution: Maintained two separate configurations
     - Use Next.js recommended config for the main application
     - Use separate `ts-node` configuration for scripts
   - Key settings restored:
     ```json
     {
       "compilerOptions": {
         "target": "es5",
         "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
         "moduleResolution": "bundler",
         "jsx": "preserve"
       }
     }
     ```

7. Build Process
   - Add pre-build checks for required files
   - Create script to validate TypeScript configuration
   - Add automated testing before build
   - Document build requirements and common issues

### Routing Issues & Solutions
1. Article Slug Implementation
   - Issues:
     - Old routes using [id] conflicted with new [slug] routes
     - API endpoints still expecting article ID instead of slug
     - Missing proper error handling for non-existent articles
     - Inconsistent URL structure between questions and articles

   - Solutions:
     - Removed old ID-based routes (`/articles/[id]`)
     - Updated API endpoints to use slug:
       - `/api/articles/[slug]/route.ts`
       - `/api/articles/[slug]/comments/route.ts`
       - `/api/articles/[slug]/like/route.ts`
     - Added proper error handling with Next.js 13+ features:
       - Created `not-found.tsx` for 404 errors
       - Added loading states with `loading.tsx`
       - Implemented error boundaries with `error.tsx`
     - Standardized URL structure to match question routes:
       - Before: `/articles/[id]/[slug]`
       - After: `/articles/[slug]`

2. Database Migration
   - Issue: Needed to add unique slugs to existing articles
   - Solution:
     - Created migration script `add-slugs.ts`
     - Added unique index on slug field
     - Generated slugs from article titles
     - Added collision handling for duplicate slugs

3. Component Updates
   - Updated `ArticleDetail` to use slug for:
     - API calls
     - Comments
     - Like functionality
   - Modified `ArticleList` for new URL structure
   - Added loading skeletons for better UX

4. SEO Considerations
   - Added proper metadata generation
   - Updated sitemap generation to use slugs
   - Ensured clean URLs for better SEO

### Technical Debt & Next Steps
8. URL Structure
   - Add URL redirection for old article URLs (if needed)
   - Implement URL validation for slugs
   - Add slug regeneration capability for title changes
   - Monitor and handle slug collisions
